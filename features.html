                  Like many anime fans, I spent countless hours scrolling through lists trying to figure out what to watch next. 
                  I'd finish an amazing series and feel that familiar emptiness‚Äîwhat now? The existing apps felt cold and impersonal, 
                  more like databases than companions in my anime journey.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-secondary fs-5 mb-4">
                  I wanted something that understood not just what I watched, but why I loved it. Something that could capture the 
                  feeling of a friend saying, "If you liked that, you'll love this!" And most importantly, I wanted to connect 
                  with other fans who shared my passion for discovering hidden gems and discussing the shows that moved us.
                </p>
                <p class="lead text-secondary fs-5 mb-0">
                  That's how RekoGen came to life. It's not just another anime app‚Äîit's a community, a discovery engine, and 
                  a personal anime companion, all wrapped in a beautiful, intuitive experience.

                    The journey to RekoGen started with a simple frustration that every anime fan has felt: the overwhelming 
                    paradox of choice. With thousands of anime titles available across multiple streaming platforms, finding 
                    your next perfect show can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Existing anime apps were either too basic‚Äîjust lists and ratings‚Äîor too complex, with cluttered interfaces 
                    that made discovery feel like work rather than joy. I wanted something that felt like having a friend who 
                    just gets your taste, someone who could introduce you to shows you'd love but might never discover on your own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it wasn't just about recommendations. Anime has always been a social experience for me. The best 
                    conversations happen when you can discuss the shows you love with people who share your passion. That's 
                    why Realms became such a core part of RekoGen‚Äîspaces where fans can connect, share theories, and discover 
                    new perspectives on their favorite shows.

                    We're still in beta, learning and improving every day based on feedback from our growing community. 
                    Every feature, every design decision, every recommendation algorithm is crafted with one goal in mind: 
                    making anime discovery personal, social, and effortless. Because when you find that perfect show, it 
                    should feel like magic.
